# Project Overview
In this project I used Jasmine to create some tests in order to check if the functionality of feedreader website worked as intended.

When index.html is run in the browser you can see which tests are run and their definitions. To learn more about the tests and how they run, please check jasmine/spec/feedreader.js. 


Google Feed API is deprecated!!
